We have to find minimum sorted rotated array

arr[] = {7,8,1,2,3,4,5,6}

So steps we have to do is:
    first we have to eliminate half of the array for that 
    check arr[l]<mid  then eliminate right half and update the answer = arr[l];
    check if arr[mid] < arr[h] then eliminate left  half and update the answer = arr[mid];

while(l<=h)
        {
           int mid = (l+h)/2;
           if(nums[l]<=nums[mid])
           {
              ans = min(ans,nums[l]);
              l = mid + 1;
           }

           else {
              ans = min(ans,nums[mid]);
              h = mid - 1;
           }
        }

        return ans;
}
