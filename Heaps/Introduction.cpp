If there should be present of k and find smallest/largest then simply it is Heap

Two types of Heap :
  1) Min heap   k + largest then use Min heap
  2) Max heap   k + smallest then use Max heap

Kth Largest then - use Min heap  (smallest element will store on top and largest will store on bottom of min heap)

If we use normal method then it will take around (nlogn)   ->   (nlogk)
