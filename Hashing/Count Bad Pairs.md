🔍 Observations & Key Insights

[Write any pattern or transformation that simplifies the problem]

[Rewrite the problem in a different mathematical form if possible]

💡 Approach 1: Brute Force

🚀 Idea:

[Explain brute-force logic]

Time Complexity: O(N²) or more

Space Complexity: O(1) / O(N)

// Brute Force Implementation void function() { // Code here }

💡 Approach 2: Optimized Using [Data Structure]

🚀 Idea:

[Explain how HashMap / Two Pointers / Prefix Sum optimizes it]

Time Complexity: O(N)

Space Complexity: O(N) (if extra storage is used)

// Optimized Implementation void function() { // Code here }

✅ Final Approach: Best Solution

[Explain why this is the best approach]

Time Complexity: O(N logN) / O(N)

Space Complexity: O(1) / O(N)
