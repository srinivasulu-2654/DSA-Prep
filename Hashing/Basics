h(x) = x % 10

the {key,value} pairs can be stored in hashmap as h(x) = x % 10

[10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,91,72] 

if there is same key for some values then to search for certain element it will take around O(n) complexity
***** search, delete, insert all it will take around O(1) in best and O(n) in worst

** will solve problems on 
  -> sliding window
  -> prefix sum
