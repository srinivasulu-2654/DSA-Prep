Knapsack Problem are 3 types :

  1) Fractional knapsack problem -> comes in Greedy  -> in this approach we can take the item weights in fractional
  2) 0/1 knapsack   -> item take or not take -> not allowed multiple occurences
  3) unbounded knapsack problem -> item can take more than 1 times


What is knapsack?
  Simply it is a bag

Problem will give these constraints:
w[]  - weights of elements
val[] - values of elements
W   - Total capacity of the bag


How to identify 0-1 knapsack problem:

w[]  - weights of elements
val[] - values of elements                - Choice  -> will take or not take
W   - Total capacity of the bag

max profit      -  Optimal 


DP - Recursion + Storage


While writig the base condition please try to think of the smallest valid input
