in the array of [6,4,2,7,1] we have to find the more number of elements which should do bitwise operation of elements
 each other then it should get greater than 0

thus we have to check each ele of bits of ith bit position should be 1
   6 - 1 1 0
   4 - 1 0 0
   2 - 0 1 0
   7 - 1 1 1
   1 - 0 0 1

for this we have to check like this if(value & (1 << i) > 0 ) then it is having greater than 0

int largestCombination(vector<int>& candidates) {
        
        int max_freq = 0;
        for(int i=0;i<32;i++)
        {
            int freq = 0;
            for(int &ele : candidates)
            {
                if((ele & (1 <<i)) != 0)
                {
                    freq++;
                }
            }

            max_freq = max(max_freq,freq);
        }

        return max_freq;
    }

TC : O(32) ~ O(N)
SC : O(1)
